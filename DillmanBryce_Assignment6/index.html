                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>My family is my world.  my girlfriend, Kayla, and I have been together for 5 months now, we got an apartment together, and do everything for our two girls.  Their names are Zaniyah and Aleenah.  Zaniyah just turned 5 and she is a very outgoing and funny.  Aleenah is almost the exact opposite.  She is very introverted, happy playing by herself, and very quirky.  I just want to have the ability to provide for them in every way I can.</p>
               
                <h2>Me</h2>
                <p>I am a very determined person and love a challenge.  I enjoy working on projects where I have to think about the task at hand in order to complete it in an efficient way.  When I start a project I am very focused on what I need to do and I feel this is one of my best qualities.  In my free time I really enjoy learning new languages to expand my skills in programming and that is what sparked my interest in the software development career path.</p>

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>I have experience using several different laguages including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                    <li>Javscript</li>
                    <li>Jquery</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Several examples of my work in these languages are located on my <a href="https://github.com/BDillman19" class="github">GitHub</a> on my Contact Page.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>The majority of my experience in the languages I am familiar with have been in a classroom setting.  If you look at my GitHub you will see the program for an autonomous robot written in python and this is my only out of class project I have completed.<br/><br/>I am a full time student and work 30 hours each week and sadly do not have enough free time to really get involved in personal projects, but I often have new ideas that I want to try.</p>
